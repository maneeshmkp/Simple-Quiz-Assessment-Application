## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

## üìã Assumptions Made

1. **Internet Connectivity**: Application assumes stable internet connection for fetching quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Designed for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled

3. **Local Storage**: Assumes browser supports localStorage for session management and result persistence

4. **Screen Sizes**: Optimized for devices with minimum width of 320px (mobile-first approach)

5. **Question Format**: Built specifically for multiple-choice questions with 4 options each

6. **Time Limit**: Fixed 30-minute assessment duration for all users

7. **Single Session**: Designed for single-user, single-session assessments (no multi-user support)

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Smooth Animations & Transitions**
**Challenge**: Creating professional animations without impacting performance
**Solution**: 
- Implemented CSS-based animations with hardware acceleration
- Used `transform` and `opacity` properties for smooth transitions
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility

### 2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers
**Solution**:
- Used modern CSS with appropriate fallbacks
- Implemented custom scrollbar styling with webkit prefixes
- Added focus management for keyboard navigation

### 3. **Responsive Design Complexity**
**Challenge**: Creating a complex layout that works on all screen sizes
**Solution**:
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Tailwind's responsive utilities for breakpoint management

### 4. **State Management for Quiz Flow**
**Challenge**: Managing complex quiz state (questions, answers, timer, navigation)
**Solution**:
- Centralized state management using React hooks
- Immutable state updates for predictable behavior
- Local storage integration for persistence

### 5. **Timer Implementation**
**Challenge**: Accurate countdown timer with auto-submit functionality
**Solution**:
- `setInterval` with cleanup in `useEffect`
- Visual warnings at critical time thresholds
- Automatic submission when timer reaches zero

### 6. **Question Navigation UX**
**Challenge**: Intuitive navigation between questions with status tracking
**Solution**:
- Visual indicators (colors, badges) for question status
- Smooth transitions between questions
- Grid-based navigation sidebar

### 7. **Data Fetching & Error Handling**
**Challenge**: Reliable question fetching from external API
**Solution**:
- Async/await pattern with try-catch error handling
- Loading states with professional spinners
- HTML entity decoding for clean question display

## üé® Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: Blue-to-purple gradient for professional, modern appearance
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Animations**: Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance UX
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support

## üîß Future Enhancements

- User authentication and progress tracking
- Multiple quiz categories and difficulty levels
- Admin dashboard for quiz management
- Real-time multiplayer assessments
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app development

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
